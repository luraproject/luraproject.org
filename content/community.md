# Community

>_Lura is developed in the open. Here are some of the channels we use to communicate and contribute._

**Mailing list**: lura-discuss@googlegroups.com - discussion around Lura usage, community support and developer discussion (very low traffic, most discussion happens on Github).

**Slack**: #krakend on https://gophers.slack.com

**Twitter**: [@luraproject](https://twitter.com/luraproject)

**Issue tracker**: Use the GitHub issue tracker to file bugs, features request and questions.

Please do not ask individual project members for support. Use the channels above instead, where the whole community can help you and benefit from the solutions provided.

## Contributing
We welcome community contributions! Please see the CONTRIBUTING.md file in the CoreDNS repository for instructions on how to submit changes. If you are planning on making more elaborate or controversial changes, please discuss them on the mailing list or on Github before sending a pull request.

## Project Governance
The Lura project is an independent open-source project and not controlled by any single company. To emphasize this and clarify our governance structure, we joined the [Linux Foundation](https://linuxfoundation.org/) in 2021.

## Code of Conduct
To make Lura a welcoming and harassment-free experience for everyone, we follow the [CNCF Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md)
